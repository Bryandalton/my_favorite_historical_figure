# My Favorite Historical Figures

## Description

A site built as a learning experiment to emulate aspects of the Crusader Kings 3(CK3) UI, specifically the three column layout with the portraits, navigable central map and collapsible profile section. Uses context to switch between figure/battle display modes and state to switch between specific figures/ battles. Built using React, React-DOM, and Styled-Components.

## Installation

Clone the git repo and run locally with:
```git clone https://github.com/Bryandalton/my_favorite_historical_figure.git```
 ```npm run dev```.

 Live build is hosted here: https://bryandalton.github.io/my_favorite_historical_figure/

## Usage

The battles/figures toggle at the top right of the screen will, when clicked, switch the page between historical battles and figures mode and will change the portraits displayed. The highlighted portion of the toggle is the active mode. Portrait buttons on the right hand side of the screen select a figure which changes the profile page on the left and the map location in the center. The portrait section is collapsible with the arrow button to the left of the section title.
